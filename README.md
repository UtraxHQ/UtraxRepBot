# Discord Reputation Bot

Welcome to the **Utrax Reputation Bot**! This bot enhances server engagement by allowing users to gain or lose reputation points based on community interactions.

## Features

- **User Reputation System**: Users can earn **Green Points** (ðŸŸ¢) or **Red Points** (ðŸ”´) based on their interactions within the server.
  - **Green Points**: Positive interactions like helpful messages or answers.
  - **Red Points**: For negative interactions, although the bot does not initiate this, it counts against the reputation.

- **Integration with Rick Bot**:
  - **Solana Contract Address Monitoring**: The bot now integrates with Rick Bot to monitor and react to Solana contract addresses shared for new coin calls.
  - **Reputation Votes for Coin Callers**: Users can vote on the accuracy or success of coin calls made by others, influencing their reputation score.

- **Leaderboard**: Keeps track of the top 10 users based on their reputation score. 
  - **Score Calculation**: Users earn points based on the difference between their green and red points.
  - **Reputation Percentage**: Shows the percentage of green points out of total points, indicating a user's overall reputation health.

- **Slash Commands**:
  - `/leaderboard`: Displays the top 10 users in the server based on their reputation.
  - `/checkuser`: Allows checking the reputation points of a specified user.
  - `/ping`: A simple command to check if the bot is active.
  - `/deletefromleaderboard`: For admins to remove a user from the leaderboard (requires administrative permissions).

- **Reaction-Based Voting**: Users can vote for messages by reacting with specific emojis (ðŸŸ¢ for positive feedback, ðŸ”´ for negative).

- **Privacy and Data Management**:
  - **Data Storage**: User reputation data is stored in a SQLite database (`points.db`).
  - **Privacy Policy**: [Link to Privacy Policy](https://github.com/UtraxHQ/UtraxRepBot/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md)
